# JCStress based playground to test Infinispan APIs

Just learning about [JCStress](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcstress/).

I often needed to "hand-roll" similar tests to verify some aspects of the
Infinispan API, so I'll consider this my playground to explore this option.

Most code here will be experiments, occasionally to share some reproducers with
the Infinispan team.
Feel free to fork this code to learn and play with it.
